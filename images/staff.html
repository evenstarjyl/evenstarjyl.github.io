<b>Dr. Brian MacKie, DVM, DVM, ACVIM/Cardiology, Veterinary Specialist</b> - Dr. MacKie, received his Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree from Washington State University in 2005. Following graduation, he completed a one-year rotating internship in small animal medicine and surgery at VCA Sacramento Animal Medical Group in Sacramento, California. After his internship, he moved to the University of Wisconsin - Madison to complete his residency training in Cardiology from 2006-2009. During his time there, Dr. MacKie helped implement the use of the Amplatz Canine Ductal Occluder at the University of Wisconsin for non-invasive treatment of a congenital heart disease, authored a paper on the use of an implantable ECG monitor for the evaluation of fainting in dogs, and assisted in prospective research on pulmonary hypertension and cardiac biomarkers. His clinical interests include, but are not limited to clinical cardiology such as echocardiography and electrocardiography (ECG), pulmonary hypertension in dogs, syncope (fainting) associated with heart disease and arrhythmias, congenital heart disease, arrhythmias, and congestive heart failure (CHF). He does have a cardiac catheterization suite for pacemaker therapy and treatment of congenital heart disease.

<b>Katie, Practice Manager</b> "I have had the pleasure of working in veterinary medicine for twenty-one years as a veterinary assistant and office manager. I have owned five Shar-pei dogs over 20 years, most of them afflicted with a breed specific illness that requires specialized care. Currently I have Kirby who is 14 years old and Sifu is 4, both rescued and suffer from Shar-pei fever. The human animal bond is something I have been lucky enough to experience and these relationships are on the highlight reel of my heart. I also have two human children who I adore and three cats.  When away from work I enjoy spending time with family and I am an avid women’s soccer fan." <br><br class="clearboth">
