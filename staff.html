<p><b>Trish Bruno, M.Ed - Veterinary Technician</b> I am a retired elementary school teacher turned veterinary/wildlife nurse. I have been working with animals for over 20 years, and finally turned my passion into a career in 2010. I live with my husband, Steve and our children in the Sacramento, California area. We have one dog, two cats, and Vanilla the pigeon.</p>

<div class="clearboth floatleft" style="margin-top:5px;"><img src="images/staff-christina-2021.jpg" width="140" height="198" alt="Christina" class="boxshadowimg"></div><p><b>Christina Bradbury DVM, MS, DACVIM.</b> Growing up on the coast in beautiful Northern California, Dr. Bradbury’s love for nature and animals started early in her childhood. Following this love, she pursued an undergraduate degree at UC Davis in Wildlife, Fish and Conservation Biology and went on to obtain a Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine from UC Davis in 2006. After an internship at Texas A&M University, she continued her veterinary training at Colorado State University, completing a combined residency and Masters of Science program. In 2010, she was board-certified in Small Animal Internal Medicine, becoming a Diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM). After her residency, Dr. Bradbury returned to Northern California and settled in the Sierra Foothills. She worked in private practice in the Sacramento area for over a decade, and started her mobile practice, Sierra Mobile Veterinary Specialists, in 2020. She now travels throughout the Central Valley, Sierra Foothills, and Tahoe region, providing minimally invasive procedures such as endoscopy, rhinoscopy, cystoscopy, bronchoscopy, laparoscopic liver biopsies, and ultrasound to veterinarians and their patients. In her free time, Dr. Bradbury enjoys adventuring outdoors and spending time with her husband and all of their animals – two very rambunctious Labradors, a very sweet (but neurotic) German Shepherd, three cats, and a rescued Thoroughbred.</p>
