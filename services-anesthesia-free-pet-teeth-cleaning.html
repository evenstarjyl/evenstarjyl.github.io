<h1>Anesthesia-Free Dental Cleaning For your Pets</h1>

<p class="floatright" style="margin-bottom:20px;">
<img src="images/teeth-cleaning4.jpg" width="277" height="300" alt="an anesthesia free dental cleaning on a pet" class="boxshadowimg"></p>

<p>Each anesthesia-free dental cleaning is performed without general anesthesia or sedation using the same cleaning techniques and instruments as dental cleanings performed under general anesthesia. All of the teeth are cleaned and polished.</p>

<p>Anesthesia-free dentals are performed by Animal Dental Care which is owned and operated by certified dental technician, Ken Kurtz.  Ken and his team have a great deal of experience and regularly perform dental cleanings on dogs and cats throughout California and other states.</p>

<p>This type of minimal dental was developed for animals that are geriatric or those which have a chronic disease or condition where routine dental cleaning under general anesthesia could possibly result in the death of the patient.</p>

<div class="box400 boxshadow brownborder exlargefont center">
All Anesthesia Free dentals are done In office only. We do not do them at house calls.</div>

<p>Heartworm, Erhlica, Anaplasma, Lyme's called a 4Dx test, Fecal (stool) with Giardia, and vaccinations (decided by doctor at time of pre-examination office call) are required for Non-Anesthetic Dentals. If your pet needs bloodwork drawn we require you have the labwork done prior to the dental procedure because we do not have in-house diagnostics.</p>

<p>If your pet needs antibiotics, probiotics will also be prescribed and need to be picked up and your pet started on them 24 to 48 hours prior to dental cleaning unless otherwise specified by the doctor. If you have any questions or would like to set up a dental please give us a call.</p>

<p><b>Please note* All non-anesthetic dental requirements are needed prior to a dental cleaning appointment: (No Exceptions)</b></p>

<h2>What To Expect</h2>

<p>Most dental cleanings take 20-30 minutes to complete. Due to limited kennel space, we kindly ask that you wait for your pet during this procedure. If your pet has a large amount of tartar or inflamed gums, our doctors may prescribe antibiotics to be given 48 hours before the dental cleaning and continued for at least 5 days after the procedure. They are not required in all patients.</p>

<p>Dental cleanings without anesthesia are available at MVC once a month. The next dental days are:</p>

<div class="center"><b>Dental Schedule 2024</b></div>
<div class="box125">
January 18<br>
February 29<br>
March 28<br>
April 25<br>
June 27<br>
August 29<br>
October 24<br>
</div>

<p>The schedule for next year will be available near the end of the year. We can put you on a waiting list for 2024 and give you a call once the dental schedule is available. We require 48 hours notice for cancellations so that other pets may be scheduled. Two cancellations will require prepayment for the service and the service will be non-refundable if it is cancelled.</p>

<div class="floatright">
<img src="images/teeth-cleaning-equip.jpg" width="248" height="300" alt="teeth cleaning equipment" class="boxshadowimg"></div>

<p>All animals referred to our hospital must also be examined by the MVC doctor prior to the procedure. Either the primary veterinarian or MVC doctor will make the decision as to which pets require antibiotics prior to cleaning. Chinese herbal prescriptions, laser or ozone may also be given for any inflammation depending on the case. These may be combined with antibiotics or used alone.</p>

<p>Imagine how your teeth would look and feel if you didn’t brush them daily. The same applies to your pets’ teeth. Bad breath and stained teeth are unappealing, but many pet owners aren’t aware that these may be symptoms of serious gum disease.</p>

<p>We provide anesthesia-free dental cleaning to both dogs and cats Our goal is to provide our Sacramento area pet owners with the best possible oral care for their pets and to help educate pet owners on how good dental care contributes to the overall good health of our pets.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
<img src="images/teeth-cleaning2.jpg" width="277" height="300" alt="vet cleaning pet's teeth" class="boxshadowimg"></div>

<p class="clearright">Our Proprietary 7-step professional teeth cleaning is performed without the use of anesthesia which also offers pet owners an alternative method for cleaning and maintaining their pet’s teeth.  Additionally, we provide advice on brushing and caring for your pets’ teeth at home.</p>

<p>Our dental technicians are highly qualified to perform a thorough dental exam on your pet without the use of anesthesia. During the examination our technicians will chart any abnormalities or concerns regarding your pet’s oral health. The next step is removing all of the plaque above and below the gum line.</p>

<div class="floatright">
<img src="images/teeth-cleaning3.jpg" width="300" height="202" alt="vet doing dental cleaning on pet" class="boxshadowimg"></div>

<p>When we are finished removing the buildup, we will polish the teeth using a fluoride-based pumice. Following your pet’s dental exam our technicians can assist you in getting started on a home maintenance program to ensure the overall health of your pet.</p>

<p>Periodontal (gum) disease is one of the most common conditions seen in pets today. The problem begins when plaque and tartar are allowed to build up on your pet’s teeth. Plaque harbors the bacteria, which can infect gum tissue and the roots of teeth resulting in disease and tooth loss.</p>

<p>Besides the negative impact on the oral health, bacteria can enter the blood stream through the large blood vessels located near the gums and teeth. At this stage, the organs with the highest blood flow are most susceptible to infections: lungs, heart, kidneys, liver and even the brain. Damage to these organs caused by infection can shorten the lives of our pets.</p>

<p>It may be recommended by your veterinarian to administer antibiotics prior to, and after, your pets dental cleaning. As of 2012, anesthesia free dentals are required by law to be performed under the direct supervision of a licensed veterinarian. All anesthetic free dental cleanings are required to have a veterinarian examine the pet prior to the dental cleaning.</p>

<p>Mobile Vet Connection, Inc. requires a complete physical examination within a minimum of 24 to 48 hours prior to the cleaning. Anesthetic Free dentals are performed only at the veterinary clinic and are not performed during house calls or as a mobile call.</p>

<p>Anesthetic free dentals are performed once a month at the clinic only and appointments book up quickly. Please call ahead to assure an appointment time for your pets dental cleaning. Only dental cleanings under anesthesia are performed at housecalls. No anesthetic free dentals are performed at mobile house calls.</p>

<p>Anesthetic free dentals require a current Rabies vaccination, a Fecal (stool) with the Giardia test, and heartworm examination (a 4DX test which includes, Heartworm, Erhlicia, Lymes, and Anaplasma). Other vaccinations (excluding Rabies vaccines may be required depending on the Doctors discretion at the time of the pre physical examination appointment). There are no exceptions. These services can be provided by your regular veterinarian or by our office upon examination (all medical records must be sent to the office prior to your pets appointment and dental cleaning).</p>

<h2>Common Questions And Answers About<br>Anesthesia-Free Dental Cleanings</h2>

<p><b>Have you found this technique to be effective with high-risk patients?</b></p>

<p><i>Yes!  Non-anesthetic dental cleanings are usually a much better alternative for older pets, and for pets with chronic kidney, liver or heart disease who might not be a candidate for general anesthesia.</i></p>

<p><b>Can a properly trained non-anesthetic dental (NAD) technician perform a cleaning on virtually any dog?</b></p>

<p><i>No. While the vast majority of dogs and cats will benefit greatly from non-anesthetic dental, there are some for whom it is not appropriate. Examples of pets who are poor candidates for non-anesthetic dental include pets with: severe gingivitis, caries, fractured teeth or stomatitis.</p>

<p>Our non-anesthetic dental (NAD) technicians are aware of the limitations of our drug-free technique. Whenever they discover a loose or fractured tooth, gum disease, tumors, epuli, abscess or any other condition that necessitates a doctor’s intervention, they are quick to bring it to the attending vet’s attention.</p>

<p> In cases where it is discovered that NAD is not appropriate, pet owners are much more receptive to traditional dental methods because they know they have tried the drug-free approach first.</i></p>

<p><b>What does the technician do if a patient is completely uncooperative, overly fearful, or demonstrates highly aggressive behavior?</b></p>

<p><i>A well-trained and experienced non-anesthetic dental (NAD) technician can usually tell within a few minutes whether the patient’s temperament will allow for a successful procedure.  In some cases, they are able to calm fearful pets enough to allow for a full cleaning. Other times they will determine that the patient’s temperament simply is not conducive to anesthesia-free treatment and they will recommend an alternative treatment approach such as <a href="services-anesthetic-dental-cleaning.html">Anesthetic Dental Cleaning</a>.</i></p>
