<p>Ozone and other oxygen therapies have been used for over 100 years around the world for human and animal healing. These therapies continue to gain acceptance as the medical community learns about the health benefits of increased oxygen in the body.Ozone is utilized on Europe as an everyday treatment for certain medical conditions.</p>

<p>Currently, ozone therapy and hyperbaric treatments, which bring easily soluble oxygen to target tissues, are being proven effective for treating viruses, fungi and bacteria, and for general health improvement anytime there is inflammation and damaged tissue.</p>

<p>Ozone contains three oxygen atoms, which react in the tissue as it breaks down to ordinary oxygen (O2) and a reactive singlet oxygen molecule that can combine with chemicals and other molecules.</p>

<p>Ozone is like a super potent form of Oxygen. It can be of benefit in any disease process in the body.</p>

<h2>How does Ozone benefit the body?</h2>

<p>The unstable quality of O3 gives it remarkable medical properties and can be considered “supercharged oxygen”.</p>

<h3>Ozone’s benefits include:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Inactivation of bacteria, viruses and fungi and protozoa</li>
<li>Decreasing inflammation</li>
<li>Activation of the immune system by stimulating production of white blood cells, interferon, interleukins, and tumor necrosis factor</li>
<li>Enhancing toxin removal from the body by stimulating metabolic function</li>
<li>Stimulating the body’s protective enzyme systems</li>
<li>Enhancing the effects of most hormones, drugs, vitamins and herbs</li>
</ul>


<h2>What conditions benefit from Ozone Therapy?</h2>

<p>Wherever there is inflammation, there is an increase in carbon dioxide in the tissue and oxygen will benefit healing in that location.</p>

<h3>The most commonly treated conditions include:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Auto-immune disease (in humans muscular dystrophy, macular degeneration)</li>
<li>Cancer</li>
<li>Chronic infections (hepatitis, cystitis, Lymes disease, herpes etc.)</li>
<li>Allergies, sinusitis</li>
<li>Intestinal diseases (IBD, colitis, etc.)</li>
<li>Ear infections</li>
<li>Dental infections</li>
<li>Arthritis</li>
<li>Chronic pain</li>
<li>Inter-vertebral disc disease</li>
<li>Wound care</li>
<li>Bacterial and viral infections</li>
</ul>

<h2>How is Ozone administered?</h2>

<p>There are many methods of administering ozone. For most applications we give it dissolved in a fluid solution that is given subcutaneously or administer humidified ozone gas directly into the colon with soft, flexible tubing. Ozone may be used topically, either suspended in an ointment or by surrounding the area to be treated with a specially designed bag that gets filled with ozone gas. It can even be safely inhaled (to treat respiratory infections) if it is first bubbled through  olive oil to make it non-irritating to the lungs. Ozone can also be mixed with the patient’s blood and given back to the patient in the form of an IV or intramuscular injection. Regardless of the method of delivery, ozone is an extremely safe and non-painful therapy.</p>

<p>How often are the treatments? Ozone therapy may be administered as frequently as twice per week depending on the patient’s symptoms and response to therapy. Most patients will benefit from treatments every 1-2 weeks. Acute conditions may need 3-6 treatments to resolve. Animals with chronic conditions may benefit from ozone therapy every 2-8 weeks for best results.</p>

<h2>Medical Ozone Therapy</h2>

<p>Medical ozone therapy has been around for over 100 years. It has been extensively used and studied in Europe and other countries. Studies and experience have consistently demonstrated that ozone is an extremely safe therapy and free from side effects when administered by a properly trained medical professional. It has proven to be a very effective treatment for a wide variety of disease conditions. It is a potent and safe anticancer, antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal agent. There are many methods of administering ozone. For most applications we give it dissolved in an IV fluid solution. It can also be used topically, either suspended in an ointment or by surrounding the area to be treated with a specially designed bag that gets filled with ozone gas. It can even be safely inhaled (to treat respiratory infections) if it is first bubbled through olive oil to make it non-irritating to the lungs.</p>

<p>By now you are probably asking “If ozone is so safe and so effective, why is it not being used by every doctor in the country?” Well, as with many alternative therapies, the AMA is under pressure from the pharmaceutical industry to ignore and/or discredit any modalities that might cut into their profits (if they don’t hold a patent on it and it keeps you from having to buy their drugs, they do not like it!). In 1933, the AMA began systematically suppressing any treatment modalities that did not complement it’s liaison with the emerging pharmacologic and diagnostic industries. Ozone therapy and therapies such as homeopathy and chiropractic were methodically eliminated from medical school education and from the public’s exposure. Europe and other countries have not suffered from this degree of suppression of anything alternative, and in many countries ozone therapy is commonplace. In fact, in Germany ambulances are fitted with ozone generators for treatment of stroke victims. The patients treated this way have a much lower incidence of permanent paralysis than do similar patients where ozone is not used.</p>

<p>Ozone (O3) is an activated, trivalent (3 atoms) form of Oxygen (O2). Ozone easily breaks down into an Oxygen molecule (O2) and a singlet oxygen atom. This singlet oxygen atom has unpaired electrons, making it unstable, and thus is sometimes referred to as an “Oxygen free radical”. In actuality, this oxygen atom behaves as an ion (O2-), NOT as a free radical at normal physiological blood pH. Thus NO HARMFUL FREE RADICAL CHAIN REACTION occurs when it attaches itself to another molecule. It is the cascading chain reactions produced by harmful free radicals that tear apart cell membranes and do damage to healthy cells of the body. So, while the O2- does seek to pair with, or “oxidize” another molecule, it is only toxic to the most vulnerable cells. Healthy cells are well protected by an enzyme coating (glutathione peroxidase, reductase, and superoxide dismutase) and are only damaged by the sort of free radicals that cause the cascading oxidative chain reactions.   Bacteria, viruses, and tumor cells do not have this enzyme coating, and thus are easily oxidized and destroyed by the oxygen atom. Singlet oxygen also acts as a scavenger for harmful type free radicals. It combines with them to render them harmless, thus protecting the body from being damaged by them. It also stimulates increased production of the enzymes that protect the healthy cells from damage, thus fortifying their ability to fend off damage from the harmful free radicals.</p>

<h3>Ozone’s benefits in the body are many. They include:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Inactivating bacteria, viruses and fungi.</li>
<li>Enhancing circulation by increasing flexibility and reducing clumping of red blood cells and by oxidizing plaque on artery walls, thus allowing it to be removed.</li>
<li>Activating the immune system by stimulating production of white blood cells, interferon, interleukins, and tumor necrosis factor.</li>
<li>Breaking down petrochemical pollutants in the body.</li>
<li>Stimulating the body’s protective enzyme systems.</li>
<li>Helping clean wastes from the body.</li>
<li>Activating the Krebs cycle of energy production, thus providing for more efficient carbohydrate metabolism and improved energy production. More efficient energy metabolism means fewer toxic byproducts produced in the process of energy production (i.e. “cleaner burning” of fuel to produce energy in the body).</li>
</ul>

<p>By facilitating more complete oxidation reactions, ozone dramatically increases the effects of most hormones, drugs, vitamins, herbs, etc. Thus, concurrent use of ozone can significantly decrease  the amount of a drug needed to achieve effect.
The work of Nobel Prize winner Dr. Otto Warburg showed that Oxygen deficit, and subsequent toxin buildup, is the underlying factor in the development and progression of ALL DISEASE PROCESSES!!!! Ozone is like a super potent form of Oxygen. It can be of benefit in any disease process in the body. A few of the conditions that respond very well to ozone therapy are infections of any kind, tumors/cancers, circulation disturbances, and Cushing’s disease. There are also reports of it being used to treat other endocrine (hormone) abnormalities such as Addison’s disease, diabetes,  hyperthyroidism, etc. as well as immune mediated diseases.</p>
